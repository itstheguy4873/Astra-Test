# About

Astra is a tool designed to enchance Roblox by providing features not currently available in the client.

Astra is available for Windows only.

**The only official downloads for Astra are this repository.**
**Any other website can potentially be malware.**

# Install

You can get Astra from [releases](https://github.com/itstheguy4873/Astra/releases).

If your antivirus software flags Astra as malicious, it doesn't mean anything. It just does this because it doesn't recognize it.

If you encounter any problems, feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/itstheguy4873/Astra/issues).
